HOW IT WORKS 

Servers
	Machines that hold shared resources
	Always connected to network

Clients 
	devices for personal use (laptops tablets phones etc)





The Internet
	LAN - Local Area Network  "Office__Building"
	WAN - Wide Area Network  "University__Buildings"

Request Response Cycle 
	
 What happens when you type something in: You the (Client) request a page and a Server responds with appropriate files. 

 Multiple Rounds of communication between client and server

URLS

Every URL has 3 parts 
  Protocol - how to connect
  Domain - Server
  Document - specific file(s)

Protocols 
 HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
 HTTPS: Secure Hypertext
 FTP: Any file


Domain Names
  identifies the entity you want to connect 
  Each has different top level domain - hierarchy if you will 
  Determined by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers(ICAAN).


IP Addresses
 Internet Protocol v6 (IPv6) is the communication protocol that identifies computers on networks
 Every computer/device has a unique IP address
 x one of 16 values combinations 

Document 
 URLS can specify a specific document 
 if no document is specified then it will be returned 

 Once IP Address is determined, the browser creates an HTTP request 
 	(headers, cookies, form data etc)

The Response
 The server returns files, not "web pages"
 Browser decides what to do with files

 If server cant fulfill the request it will send back files with error codes 404(possible typo), 500(server is down), etc
